# Quaternion

A Python class for demonstrating the use of quaternions for 3D rotations. The main event is the implementation of the `Quaternion` class in the `src/quaternion.py` file. There are also some demos which are discussed below.

This repository is a companion to [this video](https://youtu.be/hZrBGiWkUyk) which explains the implementation of the `Quaternion` class and the demos contained in this repository.

> **Note:** Some examples and documentation in this repository were AI-generated based on the video script and code snippets.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the implementation:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Basic Demo

This is the `ipython` demo from the [video](https://youtu.be/hgmLSnVuvcY) which I used to introduce this quaternion class.

```python
from src.vector3 import Vector3
from src.quaternion import Quaternion

# Quaternion representing the orientation of the Earth
q = Quaternion(0.83, 0.34, -0.44, 0.02)

# Create the basis vectors
i_hat = Vector3(1, 0, 0)
j_hat = Vector3(0, 1, 0)
k_hat = Vector3(0, 0, 1)

# Transform the basis vectors using the quaternion
print(q.transform(i_hat))
print(q.transform(j_hat))
print(q.transform(k_hat))

import math

# Construct a rotation quaternion from an axis and angle
r = Quaternion.from_axis_angle(Vector3(0, 1, 0), math.pi/2)

# Apply the rotation
q = r.multiply(q)

# Print the resulting quaternion
print(q)

# %recall 7 8 9
print(q.transform(i_hat))
print(q.transform(j_hat))
print(q.transform(k_hat))
```

## Rotation Demo

The `demo_rotate.py` script demonstrates interactive 3D rotation using quaternions. It simulates mouse drag operations on a virtual trackball to rotate a 3D Earth model. To run the demo, run the following command:

```bash
python demo_rotate.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
=== Simple Mouse Drag Rotation Demo ===

```

The visual representation of the rotations is shown below where the Earth is initially oriented with the North Pole up.

After the first drag operation, the Earth is rotated to this orientation.

After the second drag operation, the Earth is rotated to this orientation.

</picture>

In practice, it's better to calculate and apply the rotation each time the mouse moves during a drag operation. I chose to show one big rotation for demonstration purposes, but the downside of this approach is that the Earth moves in an unexpected manner during an extend drag operation (for example, dragging in a big U shape).

The benefit of applying small rotations each time the mouse moves during a drag operation is that the Earth moves in a consistent manner at the beginning and end of the drag operation. Because Quaternions are numerically stable, you don't need to worry about accumulating errors and the orientation drifting over time.

## SLERP Demo

The `demo_slerp.py` script demonstrates Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) between two orientations using quaternions. This shows how to smoothly animate between any two orientations of the Earth. To run the demo, run the following command:

```bash
python demo_slerp.py
```

You should see the following output:

```

t=1.00: q=-0.22 + 0.42i + 0.31j + 0.82k
```

The key insight of this demo is that quaternions have "double coverage" - both `q` and `-q` represent the same orientation in 3D space. When interpolating between two orientations, SLERP ensures the shortest path by checking the dot product between the quaternions. If the dot product is negative, it negates the target quaternion to ensure the rotation takes the shortest path.

The visual representation of the animations is shown below. When not ensuring the shortest path, the Earth rotates along the longer arc between the orientations.
